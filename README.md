Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game repository! This project features a fun and interactive game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50, and the player has five attempts to guess the correct number.

Description
In this number guessing game, the player competes against the computer by trying to guess a randomly selected number. The game provides feedback after each guess, helping the player inch closer to the correct answer.

How It Works
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50.
The player has 5 attempts to guess the number.
After each guess, the computer provides feedback:
"Too high" if the guess is higher than the selected number.
"Too low" if the guess is lower than the selected number.
If the player guesses the correct number within the allowed attempts, the game congratulates the player with a message:
"You have won! The correct number was X."
If the player fails to guess the correct number within 5 attempts, the game reveals the correct number:
"Game over! The correct number was X."
